# Datacentre-Energy-Optimisation-and-PV-Battery-Microgrid-Model-using-Julia
In this project, Julia is used to model the cost of energy for a Datacentre in New South Wales, Australia. Their energy cost when buying from the grid is modelled and compared to the potential cost of independently investing in a solar and BESS system to see if it is a wise investment.
